Tabs Book allows you to take a "snapshot" of your currently open document tabs—preserving their exact order and pinned status—and restore them instantly at a later time. Whether you are switching between feature branches, investigating a bug, or reviewing code, you can now save your workspace context with a custom name and return to it in seconds.
